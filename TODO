TO DO, later releases
    Label decoration visible only when rectangle hovered-over
    Better placed label (centre on cursor)
    A checkerboard background when the zoom overlay image does not cover all of the zoom canvas (to plan well)

TO DO, misc
    - another target dir for saving, default subdir named: "sfClips"
    - a "set target" button, with default ready to be created upon "save"
    - in funSave:
        - SAVE: do not overwrite! (iteratively try several numberings and labelings)
        - SAVE: a session counter for naming clips, which is reset at each dir change
            -> a button/key to reset global counter?
    - A mini-help in the status bar upon pressing 'h'

PROPOSALS
    * shortcut keys to mirror some mouse operations: c to clear rectangles, s to save, etc (keep a list)

TO DO, majors
    * suggested rectangleness
