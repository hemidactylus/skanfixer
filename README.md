# skanfixer
A program to quickly sort multi-photo scanned images

OVERVIEW
This program allows to inspect a single image file, typically coming from
scanning a bunch of photos together, and quickly define rectangles in order
to individually clip and save the items in the image, thus avoiding
the overhead associated to opening a proper image manipulation program.
